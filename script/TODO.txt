1. Modify cnnTest.py
  a. image preprocessing: change images in different resolution to same resolution
  b. set up label
  c. shuffle and split the dataset to training and testing datasets
  d. figure out how to use the batch to feed the neural net
  e. figure out how to save the model as a file, and how to load the file

2. parsingImage.py
  a. find a appropriate sigmaGM value
  b. maybe ask on forum how to parse the image more efficiently
  c. get connected components and fit lines within the component first
  d. when a correct line is fitted, remove the point on the line from the WHOLE image.
